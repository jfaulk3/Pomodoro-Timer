# Project_Pomodoro_Timer

This project was created to increase proficiency in React. 

The application contains two timers, one for engaging in a task, and the other for taking a break.
The focus timer will countdown as soon as the user presses the play button. 

When the timer reaches 0, it will switch to the break timer and reset it's own value. 
The break timer will function the same. Whenever a timer runs to zero, a small alarm 
will ring out alerting users that the timer mode is changing.

Future Goals: Add some style to the application and allow users to save their timers.
